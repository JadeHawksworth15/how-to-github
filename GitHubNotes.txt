Git = time machine
GutHub = back-up for timelines

#Start a 'timeline' aka repository folder
$ git init

# Git is not remote it is working within local computer
# Developing area = area wth git folder i.e. Documents/GitHub/
# Git repository = local repository with timeline which Git organises
# Staging area = channel between developing area and repository which facilitates preperation and implication of timeline

# Version messages --> why, what, how, effects, limitations
# Git keeps track of which lines change and what the original file was
$ git commit -m "meaningful descriptive message"

# if you don't use -m or put a message then you get error 'nothing to commit'
# if you don't put -m but do put a message you get error 'pathspec......did not match any file(s)
# If you dont put a message the you get error ' switch 'm' requires a value

$ git commit -m "You have to write a message like this"
# Error: nothing to commit

# To add changes you have to save changes - use function below
$ git add GitHubNotes.txt
# Then you can add add message
# If you want to restore before changes then use function
$ git restore file GitHubNotes.txt
